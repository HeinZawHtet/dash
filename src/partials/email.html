      Changes to your App campaigns
    </h1>
    <p>Dear Google Ads advertiser,</p>
    <p>On November 4, 2022, we’re rolling out a new format and expanding access to web page content that will impact
      your
      mobile app campaigns.</p>
    <p>You’re receiving this message because these updates will affect your app promotion campaigns in your Google Ads
      account (Customer ID: 123-456-789).</p>
    <p><strong>1. Auto-generated interactive formats:</strong> We are introducing high-quality interactive formats
      specifically designed to feature your app assets in an engaging way. Interactive formats are created from your app
      assets, such as your app icon, and metadata about your app, such as star rating, to create an interactive
      experience.</p>
    <p>Any original content you provide, as well as content automatically retrieved from the Play Store/App Store, may
      be
      dropped, cropped, or modified during the ad serving process. By choosing to promote your app with Google, you
      understand that ads for your app may show in any of these formats and across any of these networks, and that these
      ads might contain content that differs from the content you’ve provided.</p>
    <h4>How does this affect my campaign?</h4>
    <p>Improved attribution: An “engagement” will now be counted whenever a user interacts with or clicks on your
      Auto-generated interactive format. A “conversion” will be counted when a user installs your app within 30 days of
      an
      “engagement.” App ads will now bill for each “engagement” if an Auto-generated interactive format is served.</p>
    <p>Sincerely, <br />The Google Ads Team</p>
